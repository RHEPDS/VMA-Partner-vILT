The easiest way to execute rvt2doc is to copy it in a folder together with the spreadsheets (.xlsx) generated by RVTools.

Once everything is in the same folder open a comand line, CD to that folder, and execute it.

On Linux:  `./rvt2doc .`  
On Windows: `./rvt2doc.exe .`  

**Consolidated information**

The customers usually generate a spreadsheet for each datacenter. This is possible to consolidate all of them or generate different documents for each spreadsheet (processing one after the other).

For a consolidated report all the spreadsheets should be in the same folder and the utility will read all available spreadsheets generating a consolidated docx report. This is the default behaviour. A consolidated report will anyway include, differentiate and classify information per datacenter and cluster.

To generate a report for each spreadsheet (usually datacenter) each spreadsheet should be alone in the procesing folder, execute rvt2doc, copy or rename the generated file, replace the spreadsheet by the next one, and so on.
