### OpenShift Virtualisation
# Virtualization Migration Assessment - Technical Workshop vILT -
# 2 Day remote Version

Business Problem Statement 
There is a unique market opportunity now (as of CY25) for Red Hat to support customers in transitioning from VMware-based infrastructure to an OpenShift-based one, due to recent moves by the new owner of VMware, Broadcom.
